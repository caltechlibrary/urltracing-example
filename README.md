# URL Tracing example

This is a quick and dirty tour of using Python 3's urllib to trace
a list of URLs through to their final redirected address.

## Assumption

1. you have a file called *starting-urls.txt* with one url per line
2. you are going to output a CSV formated list of starting url and final url
3. we are doing this with a simple Python 3 script.
